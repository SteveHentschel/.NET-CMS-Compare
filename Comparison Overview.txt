.NET CMS Comparison Overview:  Umbraco, Orchard, MojoPortal, and Kooboo  (by Steve Hentschel)

** 12/01/2014 **
Background:  For my second pet project, I wanted to build a more complex website (endofthislife.org), and I 
figured it would be better for future maintainability to use a Content Management System.
My target is to use Visual Studio 2013, MVC5, Razor, MSSQL 2012/Express all in the .NET 4.5 framework.
Basic functionality required would be blog/forum and some media support for user galleries.

In this blurb (I know blog would be better, but until I make one ...) I will just go over some of my
initial findings via Google research on the four packages I chose to evaluate.

Platform
Umbraco and MojoPortal are based on WebForms, whereas Kooboo and Orchard were written with MVC.  
I would prefer to use an MVC-based CMS, but in the end it doesn't matter so much as they all 
support MVC-based web applications.

Usage
According to w3techs.com, Umbraco is the most popular CMS of the four, followed by Orchard.  MojoPortal
is third in usage (pretty close to Orchard), and then Kooboo brings up the rear.

Pricing
All four CMS options are free open source software.  Orchard and Kooboo have no hidden fees, whereas
Umbraco and MojoPortal have some higher end features that are paid options. Umbraco also charges EU 20
per month for viewing of their tutorial videos (umbraco.tv) and offers different levels of paid support.

Company/Website Impressions
Umbraco is based in Denmark with a team of 9 employees and has a very nice/modern website.
Orchard Project doesn't seem to be based physically anywhere, but due to it's association with MicroSoft, 
I'd put it in Redmond, Washington with a team of 6-10 international development/board members.  The
Orchard website is simple, but clean, functional and looks nice.
MojoPortal appears to be a one man show with Joe Audette running things from North Carolina.  Of the 
four choices, the MP site looks the most dated and cluttered with advertisements, but you can't
begrudge a guy for trying to make a living.
Kooboo also has a very simple, but clean and functional (like Orchard).  Kooboo was developed in Xiamen, 
China by a team of 6-8, but they also have satellite offices in Los Angeles and the Netherlands.

Community/Support
Umbraco has the most active support forum with tons of recent posts and contributors (our.umbraco.org).
Umbraco also has an active release history and a good future roadmap.
Orchard also has an active/current forum with many contributors; also a good release history and roadmap.
MojoPortal community is ok, but not quite as active as Umbraco and Orchard.  Activity seems to have 
subsided around 2012 and the development seems stuck at .NET 4.0.
Kooboo community support seems similar to MP with not so many current postings.  Kooboo seems mostly 
tailored to supporting multilingual websites.

That's it for the initial light research.  Next, I will install each CMS and create a quick test site
and report the results in separate blurbs.  After that I will update this thread with my final choice(s).

** 12/5/2014 **
First cut:  After a few days of initial evaluation of the four CMS packages, I have decided to cut out 
MojoPortal and Kooboo.  As I mentioned before, MojoPortal feels too dated and 'plug-and-playish' to me, 
and it looks like it does not have such a great community support system.  Even the company it recommends 
for skins (Artisteer) does not support direct output to Mojo, which shows who they are not betting on.  
Kooboo has a great looking site manager and is based on MVC, but again, I don't get a warm fuzzy about the 
community and module support.  Several forum threads end with Kooboo admins stating they will not create
xx feature, but the user is welcome to develop it, and from the catalog of modules, I can see that not
many users do that (in Kooboo at least).

So, that leaves me to pursue Orchard and Umbraco.  Umbraco has the edge when it comes to sheer user base 
and community developed modules and plug-ins.  Visual Studio has over 7 pages of Umbraco packages to 
explore with NuGet.  Umbraco also has the most active and supportive community (our.umbraco.org).  While 
Orchard does not have quite the same exposure or community support, it is backed by MicroSoft and I do 
see quite a lot of activity on the Codeplex forum.  It also is written with MVC which is more interesting
to me, but not so essential.

Ultimately, it will come down to which package can supply/support the feature I want on my website and has 
the best feel for editing and updating my site.  As I mentioned before, the main add-ons I'm looking for:
- Forum: nice, friendly, medium powered
- Blog: easy to create, easy to comment, good SEO
- Media: ability to store/display movies and pics
- DB Interaction:  will be doing some of this, hopefully with LINQ

I will update the Orchard and Umbraco blurbs with my findings on these 4 points, and then finally announce
my end choice here when that is finished.

** 12/13/2014 **  Blog Test Results
And after Round 1, blog testing, the winner is .......  Umbraco and Articulate.  To summarize (you can see
details in the Umbraco and Orchard blurbs), uBlogsy for Umbraco was kind of buggy and felt kind of 
'small time'.  Blogs built-in for Orchard was very basic feeling with no bells or whistles that I could
find.  Articulate seemed to have the most interest and felt very nice, intuitive, and powerful, even though
it supposedly is not a full-fledged blogging system (like WordPress).  I also found I liked the connectivity
of Disqus.  So, Round 1 to Umbraco/Articulate blogging.  Round 2 is the forum testing.

** 12/14/2014 **  Forum Test Results
The Round 2 Forum test winner is .... again Umbraco with Dialogue.  Dialogue was way more powerful and 
feature-packed than the standard Forum module on Orchard (ngmForum).  Seems Orchard has all the basic
functionality and lets you add what you want thru extensions, but why reinvent the wheel when Umbraco has
all the packages with all the bells and whistles already available.  My only issue will be putting Dialogue
under the same root as my main website, and also figuring out how to merge the two separate logins.
