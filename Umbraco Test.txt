Umbraco CMS Install and Initial Site Creation
12/5/2014  Steve Hentschel

Installation
Umbraco CMS is the only package where you don't download the source code.  From Visual Studio, just create
a new EMPTY web project, and load the Umbraco CMS package (I got Version 7.2.0) via the NuGet package 
manager.  One nice thing about Umbraco is that it loads very light with only one project.  Some documentation
says you should change the defaultRenderingEngine parameter from Webforms to MVC, but both times loading 
from VS (MVC4 or MVC5 package) this was already set.  Just build and run and this opened the starter site
setup screen right out of the box, nice.

Playing with the Site
Sample site setup consists of choosing your DB connection and picking a starter kit, if you like.  I opted
for the Fanoe starter kit, just to see a site come up.  It was clean and simple, nice to see. The admin 
screen and database setup is very similar to Orchard, very friendly and intuitive.  Umbraco prides itself on
being very open and customizable (opposite of plug and play).  I created a new page quickly, but was not 
so happy about how to add/arrange images on it; I guess this was the type of template I was using though.  
All new pages and page mods are stored in the SQL database (also like Orchard).  Also doesn't matter which 
type of new project you create (MVC4 orMVC5), after you load Umbraco CMS, it will only use the MVC4 reference.

Blog/Forum/Media
There was no built-in blog (like Orchard), but there are a few blog packages out there (uBlogsy and 
Articulate), which I'll have to investigate further.  The Fanoe starter kit comes with a basic blog, but I 
didn't check which of those (if any) it was based on.  There are also a few forum packages out there 
(nForum and MVC Forum), but I still see some question as to whether or not they work with Umbraco 7.

First Impression
Umbraco is the most widely used CMS of the 4 packages I chose to investigate and I can see why.  The admin 
functions are somewhat intuitive, if not simple, but that is a good thing for do-it-yourselfers.  Umbraco
definitely makes the first cut, and I'll soon delve deeper to investigate the features I'm looking for.
