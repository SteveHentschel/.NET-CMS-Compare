Umbraco CMS Install and Initial Site Creation
12/5/2014  Steve Hentschel

Installation
Umbraco CMS is the only package where you don't download the source code.  From Visual Studio, just create
a new EMPTY web project, and load the Umbraco CMS package (I got Version 7.2.0) via the NuGet package 
manager.  One nice thing about Umbraco is that it loads very light with only one project.  Some documentation
says you should change the defaultRenderingEngine parameter from Webforms to MVC, but both times loading 
from VS (MVC4 or MVC5 package) this was already set.  Just build and run and this opened the starter site
setup screen right out of the box, nice.

Playing with the Site
Sample site setup consists of choosing your DB connection and picking a starter kit, if you like.  I opted
for the Fanoe starter kit, just to see a site come up.  It was clean and simple, nice to see. The admin 
screen and database setup is very similar to Orchard, very friendly and intuitive.  Umbraco prides itself on
being very open and customizable (opposite of plug and play).  I created a new page quickly, but was not 
so happy about how to add/arrange images on it; I guess this was the type of template I was using though.  
All new pages and page mods are stored in the SQL database (also like Orchard).  Also doesn't matter which 
type of new project you create (MVC4 orMVC5), after you load Umbraco CMS, it will only use the MVC4 reference.

Blog/Forum/Media
There was no built-in blog (like Orchard), but there are a few blog packages out there (uBlogsy and 
Articulate), which I'll have to investigate further.  The Fanoe starter kit comes with a basic blog, but I 
didn't check which of those (if any) it was based on.  There are also a few forum packages out there 
(nForum and MVC Forum), but I still see some question as to whether or not they work with Umbraco 7.

First Impression
Umbraco is the most widely used CMS of the 4 packages I chose to investigate and I can see why.  The admin 
functions are somewhat intuitive, if not simple, but that is a good thing for do-it-yourselfers.  Umbraco
definitely makes the first cut, and I'll soon delve deeper to investigate the features I'm looking for.

12/12/2014 -- Blog Testing
I finished blog testing today on Umbraco.  The two main choices for me were uBlogsy by Anthony Dang and 
Articulate by Shannon Deminick.  Initially I was leaning towards uBlogsy since Articulate farms it's 
comments out to Disqus,and I thought I wanted my comments done locally.  But after loading both up in 
the Umbraco CMS and making a few test posts, I really found Articulate to be the friendlier and more 
intuitive package.  I also ran into many bugs and issues with uBlogsy (I don't think it's ready for U7 
yet, tbh), and I also got the feeling that it was a little too much project spread with uCommentsy, 
uLemsy, etc; just a little too uCutesy for me.

If I decide to go with Umbraco, I definitely will use Articulate as my blogging engine.  The developer is
an Umbraco employee and his blog package seems to fit seamlessly within the CMS.  I guess my biggest 
challenge will be to get Articulate to run under my main root site, as I couldn't quite figure that out
in this initial round, but if I choose Umbraco, I can dig into that when the time comes.

Tomorrow I start blog testing on the Orchard CMS.  -- slh


12/14/2014 -- Forum Testing
It seems nForum by Lee (guards his last name very well) has been the mainstay forum package for Umbraco, 
but that supposedly only works up to V1.6.  Luckily Lee (Leen3o) has just ported his TheMVCForum module 
to Umbraco 7 in the form of a pakcage called Dialogue via his UK business (aptitude.co.uk).  Dialogue is 
easily downloaded and installed via the Umbraco repository in the Developer section.  I had a few bugs / 
runtime errors initially, but I think it's cuz I didn't follow the instruction on GitHub regarding 
publishing various areas and setting up a Dialogue admin user.

Once Dialogue was up and running, it definitely exceeded expectations.  So many features and options you 
would expect in a modern forum/bulletin board, very much better out of the box than the Forums 101 module 
for Orchard.  My main concern is that it seems to function very much as a stand-alone site (like TheMVCForum)
and I'm not sure how to incorporate it into my site's main root.  I saw some post that said it might not 
be possible and would have to be run as a main or subdomain.  I also have no idea how to separate logins
of the main site and the forum, or join them if need be.  I'll have to figure that out when the time
comes, but I think the utility of Dialogue will be worth the effort.

12/22/2014 -- Umbraco Learning
I spent the past few days running thru some Umbraco videos and tutorials to get the basics down before I 
start to tackle my project.  Learning about Document Types, Properties, Data Types, Templates, and how they
all fit together is not so difficult a task, but also one should not expect plug-and-play site development 
from Umbraco.  I feel like once you grasp the Umbraco methodology, it is the best and most versatile and 
customizable CMS framework for .NET out there atm (just like I read in most of the CMS comparison articles).

Two resources I found most helpful for getting into Umbraco V7 were:  1) the newer Version 7 videos on 
Umbraco TV (http://umbraco.tv/videos/umbraco-v7).  Specifically, the Implementor section was most applicable
to me for my current site design project.  Many vids are free, some require the TV membership (especially
the more detailed developer series), but it may be worth the $23 for a month worth of study.  2) the Umbraco
forum Documentation section has an excellent starter tutorial called "Creating a Basic Website using Umbraco
V7.1" (http://our.umbraco.org/documentation/Using-Umbraco/Creating-Basic-Site).  This is the perfect step
after some basic videos studies, as it walks you through how to create a nice 3 page Umbraco site from 
scratch, which seems to address the most common complaint I read about seeing that first, bare naked 
Umbraco admin page ... "What do I do now ?  How do I start ?"

My next step now is to sit down and really figure out how I want my project site to be laid out, page 
structures, how many doc types, new and unique data types I'll need, etc., etc.  Setting the blueprint for
your site takes time and foresight and planning, but once that is all figured out, then use Umbraco to bring
the site to life in an easy and logical manner (at least that's the plan).
