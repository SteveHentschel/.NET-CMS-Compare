MojoPortal Install and Initial Site Creation
12/2/2014  Steve Hentschel

Installation
Since I am working with VS2013, I downloaded the source code via CodePlex and unzipped to my project area.
Then open the mojoportal solution file (I got Version 2.4.0.4) and build/run the mojoPortal.Web project.
Kind of bulky with 25 projects and would not run out of the box on my system (Win7, .NET 4.5.1).
Through the runtime errors, tracked it down to the Webstore.UI project.  Deleted that and the program/site
ran fine.  Probably should delete all the other projects not used for efficency.

Playing with the Site
The greenish-yellow default sample site appears in your designated browser and you can look around.  
Login as "admin@admin.com" with a password of 'admin' and you can modify the site or turn it into your own.
Most aspects of the site can be managed from the "Administration" menu.  Much you can do here and it makes
this CMS feel very much like a template-based site creation process (but with much more control)
New pages are easy to create and edit, with 8 premade content features that can be set in a 3-pane
layout.  13 premade skins come with the original install, and MP suggests using Artisteer for new skin 
development.  It seems the relationship with Artisteer is old and not so great anymore, as the Artisteer 
ad is gone and Artisteer does not support direct output to MojoPortal.

Blog/Forum/Media
There are blog, forum, and various media modules in the Features.UI project that can be linked to the
Web project, but I'm not going to evaluate these until I see the other CMS installs and sample sites.

First Impression
Right now, I'm not so impressed with MojoPortal as it feels and looks a bit dated/klunky to me.  Just my 
personal opinion mind you, but when designing my next pet project, my opinion is all that really matters.
MojoPortal reminds me of one of those DIY website creators (albeit way more advanced) and has the 
plug-and-play feel that makes me think it is more removed from MVC development than I want to be.

I may come back for more MP evaluation and try out the forum/blog if I'm not more impressed by one
of the other 3 CMS programs coming up (Kooboo, Orchard, or Umbraco).
