Orchard Project Install and Initial Site Creation
12/3/2014  Steve Hentschel

Installation
The Orchard installation process was basically the same as Mojo; download the Orchard Source from 
orchard.codeplex.com (Version 1.8.1 in my case), and then unzip to Projects and open the solution file
with Visual Studio 2013.  The solution takes quite a while to build the first time, as it loads pretty 
heavy with a whopping 75 projects.  After setting up the database and connecting, Orchard also loads the 
DB right away with a ton of tables for site management; nothing small in the Orchard.  Was nice that the
solution loaded and ran with no problems straight out of the box.

Playing with the Site
The test site comes up a bit slowly the first time, but it is very sharp/clean looking.  Sign in as 'admin' 
and set a new password, and you are ready to start playing with your site.  Click the 'Dashboard' link at 
the bottom of the screen and you are presented with a very logical admin menu in the left column.  I played 
around a bit, created a new page and added images to it with no problems.  Orchard comes with a gallery
of 103 themes from various authors/sources, and also allows you to import your own if you like.  I appreciate
the fact that Orchard allows Bootstrap which comes standard in MVC5 projects now.

Blog/Forum/Media
There is a blog tab in the Admin menu, and adding a blog with a new post can be done in minutes.  Very nice.
It looks like there is only one premade forum available for Orchard (NGM), but I will evaluate that later.
Same for media.

First Impression
At first glance, I like Orchard Project CMS very much.  Being somewhat familiar with MVC, it just feels
more natural to me than MojoPortal, and I like the clean, structured, logical flow of the admin panel and
how things are laid out.  Just feels more natural to me, and could be the one.  Will update more after 
checking out Kooboo and Umbraco.

12/13/2014 -- Blog Testing
There really is not so much to test for blogging on the Orchard CMS, since the only common package I could 
find was the one that came packaged with Orchard (called Blogs 1.8.1 in the Modules section).  I made a few 
blog posts and did some commenting.  All was very easy and intuitive, but the word that comes to mind
when describing the package overall is 'rudimentary'.  Not many bells nor whistles come with this package
that I could find.

The commenting is self contained, which is what I thought I wanted in a blogging package, but after seeing
the multi-app connectivity associated with Disqus, I'm not so sure anymore.  This package also looked very
plain and vanilla, but I guess I could have changed the theme on it to spruce it up.

Next will be Forum testing here on Orchard.  -- slh


12/13/2014 -- Forum Testing
I had two target forum packages I wanted to test with the Orchard CMS.  The first used to be called 
ngm Forums, I assume for the creator, Nicholas Mayne.  This has since turned into a module called 
Forum 1.0.1 which is directly loaded from the Orchard gallery, nice and easy.  Unfortunately, this forum
package is very similar to the built-in blog package for Orchard in that it is very basic, not very 
exciting at all.  Replies/comments are very basic as well, with no built-in avatar support or reputation system that I could 
find.  I suspect these might come in separate modules, but I did not go that far.

The second forum package I wanted to test was called The MVC Forum (Version 1.5) by a designer called 
Lee (Leen3o) from Aptitude.  Unfortunately, as far as I could tell, this package cannot be run under 
Orchard.  It appears to be meant to run as a stand-alone site, or maybe run as a subdomain from your main
site.  I did download the source and run it from VS as a stand-alone, and man, it does not fail to impress.
Very nice package with many features and very intuitive to use.  If Umbraco does not have a version of this,
I think I'll have to find a way to reference this from my main site somehow as a subdomain.

Next, I'll look at nForum/Dialogue on Umbraco.  -- slh
