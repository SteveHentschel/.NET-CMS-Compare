Orchard Project Install and Initial Site Creation
12/3/2014  Steve Hentschel

Installation
The Orchard installation process was basically the same as Mojo; download the Orchard Source from 
orchard.codeplex.com (Version 1.8.1 in my case), and then unzip to Projects and open the solution file
with Visual Studio 2013.  The solution takes quite a while to build the first time, as it loads pretty 
heavy with a whopping 75 projects.  After setting up the database and connecting, Orchard also loads the 
DB right away with a ton of tables for site management; nothing small in the Orchard.  Was nice that the
solution loaded and ran with no problems straight out of the box.

Playing with the Site
The test site comes up a bit slowly the first time, but it is very sharp/clean looking.  Sign in as 'admin' 
and set a new password, and you are ready to start playing with your site.  Click the 'Dashboard' link at 
the bottom of the screen and you are presented with a very logical admin menu in the left column.  I played 
around a bit, created a new page and added images to it with no problems.  Orchard comes with a gallery
of 103 themes from various authors/sources, and also allows you to import your own if you like.  I appreciate
the fact that Orchard allows Bootstrap which comes standard in MVC5 projects now.

Blog/Forum/Media
There is a blog tab in the Admin menu, and adding a blog with a new post can be done in minutes.  Very nice.
It looks like there is only one premade forum available for Orchard (NGM), but I will evaluate that later.
Same for media.

First Impression
At first glance, I like Orchard Project CMS very much.  Being somewhat familiar with MVC, it just feels
more natural to me than MojoPortal, and I like the clean, structured, logical flow of the admin panel and
how things are laid out.  Just feels more natural to me, and could be the one.  Will update more after 
checking out Kooboo and Umbraco.
