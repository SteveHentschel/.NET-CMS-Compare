Kooboo Install and Initial Site Creation
12/4/2014  Steve Hentschel

Installation
Again, Kooboo installation is pretty much the same as Orchard and Mojo; just download the Kooboo source
(I got Version 4.3 dated Feb 2014) from CodePlex, extract to your project file, just open the solution 
file from VS2013.  The big difference with Kooboo is it comes much lighter and leaner with only one 
project to build.  Build and run happened very quickly with no problems the first time, nice.

Playing with the Site
The SampleSite comes up quickly when run and looks very clean and nice, the basic MS MVC web app template.
Hit "Admin Login" and sign in with admin/admin to get to the Site Manager screen.  Here's where things 
start to vary from Orchard, as the Kooboo admin interface is not quite as clean/intuitive as Orchards. 
The Site Cluster screen shows an excellent world wide template support, but it takes a while to figure 
out how/where to press buttons and controls to navigate and create.  I did manage to make a new page with
images, but not quite as quickly/easily as with Orchard.  Changing themes was not transparent either; it 
looks like you have to download/import new themes, and I didn't see any extra skins or theme management
tool in the panel (although I didn't look too long either).

Blog/Forum/Media
While it looks like Kooboo is leaner than Orchard, I believe it is every bit as powerful and versatile,
but just not so easy or intuitive to find the functionality.  I also didn't get a good feeling for the 
blog/forum modules that are available (or not).  Again, will have to do more research in that area.

First Impression
At this point, I would put Kooboo as a close second behind Orchard.  I like that it is more lean and 
compact, but I guess I can cut Orchard down to size when I know what project I do/don't need.  Kooboo 
feels like the right choice for multingual international web developers, but I'm not heading that way.
After the Umbraco test I will cut the choices to two and then get into a more detailed evaluation, 
especially of the modules/plug-ins I need (like forum, blog, and media players).
